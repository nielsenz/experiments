Based on the transcript from the January 22, 2026, episode of *Bet the Process*, here are the betting picks and recommendations for the upcoming NFL conference championships and a recap of the College Football Championship.

### **NFL: Seattle Seahawks vs. Los Angeles Rams (NFC Championship)**

*   **Kenneth Walker (SEA) Receiving Yards: Under 24.5**
    *   **Line:** 24.5
    *   **Reasoning:** Adam Levitan (ETR) notes their model has a mean of 23.7. He identifies this as his "favorite bet on this game" given the market is slightly higher at 24.5.
*   **Game Total: Over 46.5**
    *   **Line:** 46.5
    *   **Reasoning:** Jeff Ma believes the total is too low. He expects a high-scoring game because Seattle has historically moved the ball well against the Rams' defense, provided they avoid turnovers.
*   **Kenneth Walker (SEA) Anytime Touchdown**
    *   **Reasoning:** With backup Zach Charbonneau out (ACL), Walker is expected to see a massive snap share (potentially 80-85%). He will no longer lose short-yardage and goal-line carries to Charbonneau.
*   **Rams Pass Rush / Blitzing**
    *   **Strategy:** Adam Levitan suggests the Rams should "blitz constantly" off the left tackle spot because Seattle is down to their 4th-string left tackle. Sam Darnold is noted to struggle significantly under pressure.

### **NFL: New England Patriots vs. Denver Broncos (AFC Championship)**

*   **Austin Hooper (NE) Anytime Touchdown: +850**
    *   **Odds:** +850
    *   **Reasoning:** Levitan identifies $34.86 of EV on this prop. He notes the best way to attack the Broncos' defense is via tight ends and running backs, as their cornerbacks (Surtain and Moss) have been elite on the outside.
*   **Rhamondre Stevenson (NE) Player Overs / Usage**
    *   **Reasoning:** Levitan points out that Stevenson’s split with Trevion last week was due to a temporary eye injury, not a change in depth chart. Once cleared, the team returned to "heavy, heavy Rhamondre," suggesting his market lines may be undervalued based on last week's raw stats.
*   **Denver Broncos +4.5**
    *   **Line:** +4.5 (Current) / New England -3.7 (Peabody Line)
    *   **Reasoning:** Rufus Peabody’s model makes the line New England -3.7, suggesting value on Denver at +4.5. Adam Levitan also expects the line to move down toward the Broncos.
*   **Jared Stidham (DEN) Efficiency**
    *   **Reasoning:** Levitan argues Stidham is a "top seven-ish" backup and was "unreal" in the preseason. He believes the drop-off from Bo Nix to Stidham is roughly 4.5 points, and Stidham will be competent in Sean Payton’s quick-screen/short-pass offense.

### **NFL Awards / Futures**

*   **Matthew Stafford (LAR) MVP**
    *   **Odds:** Trading at 87–88 cents on Coliseum/Polymarket.
    *   **Reasoning:** While Drake May has a better analytical profile (EPA per dropback), Levitan believes Stafford is a "shoe-in" because voters will favor the veteran narrative and his ability to elevate players like Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp.

### **College Football Championship (Recap/Retrospective)**

*   **Miami +8.5:** Jeff Ma took a position here to middle his Indiana futures.
*   **Game Total Under:** Jeff Ma "still really liked the under" despite the late-game volatility, citing conservative play-calling and Indiana's strong defense.
*   **Indiana -6.8/6.9:** Rufus Peabody’s modeled number for the game.
