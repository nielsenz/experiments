Based on the "Forward Progress" podcast transcript for the NFL divisional round, here are the betting picks and recommendations:

### **Buffalo Bills at Denver Broncos**
*   **Lean: Denver Money Line (-116)**
    *   **Reasoning:** Buffalo is severely injury-depleted (Palmer, Davis, Shavers on IR; Allen banged up). Denver is healthier coming off a bye and has a coaching advantage with Sean Payton.
*   **Lean: Under 46.5**
    *   **Reasoning:** Both teams likely to use run-centric scripts to protect their quarterbacks and shorten the game. Denver's defense funnels to the run, and Buffalo's interior defense is a weakness.

### **Seattle Seahawks at San Francisco 49ers**
*   **Recommendation: Pass / No Bet**
    *   **Reasoning:** The market is in flux due to Sam Darnold’s oblique injury. While Seattle has the rest advantage and San Francisco is "beat up" (missing Kittle, Warner, and potentially Pearsall), the uncertainty surrounding Darnold’s accuracy and variance makes it an "unknown."

### **Houston Texans at New England Patriots**
*   **Pick: New England -3 (-118)** (Austin Mock & G-Stack)
    *   **Reasoning:** Nico Collins' concussion is a massive loss for Houston's offense. C.J. Stroud has struggled under pressure, while Patriots' QB Drake May has shown poise and scrambling ability. Potential snow favors New England’s defense and hinders Houston’s pass rush.
*   **Lean: New England -3** (Rob Pizzola)
    *   **Reasoning:** Houston lacks explosive playmaking without Collins; the Patriots' defense features complex disguises that could confuse Stroud.

### **Los Angeles Rams at Chicago Bears**
*   **Pick: Over 48.5** (Rob Pizzola)
    *   **Reasoning:** Cold weather (15°F) is being overblown; tackling actually becomes harder in the cold, favoring the offense. Both offenses (led by McVay and Ben Johnson) have significant advantages over the opposing defenses. 
*   **Pick: Rams -3.5 (-118)** (Suma & G-Stack)
    *   **Reasoning:** The Rams have a superior rushing attack (Dotson returning to the O-line; Kyron Williams/Blake Corum) that matches up well against a Bears defense that struggles when not creating turnovers.
*   **Lean: Rams Team Total Over** (Mentioned as a viable alternative to the full game total).

### **Summary of Official Crew Picks**
*   **Rob Pizzola:** Rams/Bears Over 48.5
*   **Austin Mock:** Patriots -3 (-118)
*   **Suma:** Broncos ML & Rams -3.5
*   **G-Stack:** Patriots -3 & Rams -3.5
