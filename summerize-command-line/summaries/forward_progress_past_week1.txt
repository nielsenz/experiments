Based on the transcript from *Forward Progress*, here are the betting picks and recommendations for the NFL Championship Sunday edition.

### **New England Patriots vs. Denver Broncos**
**Current Line:** New England +4.5 | **Total:** 42.5

**Official "Hammer" Play**
*   **New England Patriots +4.5 (-108):** (G-Stack) Reasoning: Denver's defense is overrated due to a soft early schedule and has regressed since their bye (dropping from 4th to 14th in EPA). New England’s defense is elite when Milton Williams is active, and the market has failed to adjust to the Patriots covering nearly every spread for two months.

**Picks & Leans**
*   **New England +4.5:** (Summa, Austin Mok) Summa notes that while the O-line matchup is scary, the Patriots can attack the middle of Denver's coverage with Hunter Henry and Stefan Diggs.
*   **Denver Broncos -4.5:** (Rob Pizzola) Reasoning: Believes the fair price is 3.5; thinks the market is overreacting to the Bo Nix injury and that Jared Stidham is a competent fit for Sean Payton’s system.
*   **Under 42.5:** (Austin Mok, Summa, G-Stack)
*   **Over 42.5:** (Rob Pizzola)

**Player Props**
*   **RJ Harvey (DEN) Over 18.5 Receiving Yards:** (Rob Pizzola) Reasoning: Stidham relies on dump-offs and screens; Harvey was heavily involved in the passing game last week and this number should be in the mid-20s.
*   **Hunter Henry (NE) Over Receiving Yards / 5+ Receptions (+154):** (Summa) Reasoning: Denver is vulnerable to TEs over the middle; Henry is a primary target for Drake May under pressure.
*   **Rhamondre Stevenson (NE) Over Receptions:** (G-Stack) Reasoning: Stevenson is the designated pass-blocking back (out-snapping rivals 80 to 51) and serves as the "quick relief" valve for May against Denver's heavy blitz.

### **Los Angeles Rams vs. Seattle Seahawks**
**Current Line:** Seattle -2.5 (-106) | **Total:** 46.5 / 47

**Picks & Leans**
*   **Seattle Seahawks -2.5:** (Summa, Austin Mok) Reasoning: Seattle’s run defense is elite and matches up well against Kyron Williams. Summa notes the Rams' 7-1 turnover advantage in previous meetings is due for massive regression.
*   **Los Angeles Rams +2.5:** (Rob Pizzola, G-Stack) Reasoning: Pizzola makes the line Seattle -1.5; notes the Rams are at their "market low" and are the more complete team. G-Stack notes the Rams' offense was missing key personnel (Adams, Dotson) in the last meeting.
*   **Under 47:** (Rob Pizzola, G-Stack, Austin Mok) Reasoning: Expecting a run-heavy script from Seattle to protect Sam Darnold’s injury; Seattle's "two-high" shell defense prevents explosive plays.

**Player Props**
*   **Sam Darnold (SEA) Under 5.5 Rushing Yards:** (Rob Pizzola) Reasoning: Darnold is nursing an oblique injury; his mobility will be limited, and kneel-downs at the end of the game could further reduce his yardage.
*   **Terence Ferguson (LAR) Over 14.5 Receiving Yards / Over 1.5 Receptions (+148):** (G-Stack) Reasoning: Seattle plays "two-high" shells that concede underneath routes to tight ends; Ferguson and Parkinson are the clear top options in Stafford’s TE pecking order.
*   **Rashid Shaheed (SEA) Over 1.5 Rushing Yards:** (Rob Pizzola) Reasoning: Note that while Pizzola liked this at 1.5, he noted it has "steamed" to 4.5. He expects Seattle to use Shaheed in the run game to supplement Kenneth Walker.
