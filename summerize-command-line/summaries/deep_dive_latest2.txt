Based on the podcast transcript, here are the extracted betting picks and recommendations for the NFL Divisional Round:

### **Buffalo Bills @ Denver Broncos**
*   **Denver Broncos Money Line / -1 (-107/ -109):** 
    *   **Picks:** Drew (Bet Denver at plus money earlier; fair line is -2). Andy predicts a 23-20 Broncos win.
    *   **Reasoning:** Buffalo is playing a second consecutive road game at altitude. The Bills' receiving corps is depleted by injuries (down to Shakir, Kincaid, and Knox), making them one-dimensional against an elite Denver defense featuring Patrick Surtain II and Talanoa Hufanga.
*   **Game Total Under 46 / 45.5:**
    *   **Picks:** Drew and Andy both lean Under.
    *   **Reasoning:** Expectation of an "ugly" game where Denver focuses on avoiding turnovers and running the ball to kill the clock.
*   **Prop – James Cook (Bills) Rushing Yards (O/U ~75):**
    *   **Lean:** Andy likes Cook to have a "big game" as the Bills' primary matchup advantage, though Drew is wary of the Broncos' rush defense (haven't allowed a 100-yard rusher since Week 2).

### **Seattle Seahawks @ San Francisco 49ers**
*   **Seattle Seahawks +7.5 / +7:**
    *   **Picks:** Drew (Teaser) and Andy (Teaser). Drew notes the fair line shouldn't be as high as 7.5.
    *   **Reasoning:** The 49ers are missing key weapons (George Kittle, Brandon Aiyuk). Seattle’s rush defense, led by Ernest Jones, is built to stop Christian McCaffrey. Sam Darnold has been highly efficient when protected.
*   **Game Total Under:**
    *   **Pick:** Drew (Lean).
    *   **Reasoning:** Potential for Seattle to dominate defensively, with a score prediction like "20-something to 3."
*   **Prop – AJ Barner (Seahawks TE):**
    *   **Lean:** Andy identifies Barner as a "fantasy proppy guy" who could unlock successful drives against the Niners' current defensive scheme.

### **Houston Texans @ New England Patriots**
*   **Patriots -3 (+102):**
    *   **Pick:** Drew.
    *   **Reasoning:** Patriots have the "1B" offense in the league (behind the Rams). They have a significant situational advantage playing their third straight game at home while Houston travels for the second week in a row.
*   **Game Total Over 40.5 (-128):**
    *   **Pick:** Drew (Considers this the "best bet of the weekend").
    *   **Reasoning:** Both teams have explosive potential. Drake May can overcome sacks with big plays, and CJ Stroud is much more effective indoors.
*   **Patriots Team Total Over:**
    *   **Pick:** Drew ("Secret pod play").
*   **Prop – Drake May (Patriots) Passing Yards Leader (6:1 or 7.5:1):**
    *   **Pick:** Drew.
    *   **Reasoning:** Drake May is the archetypal QB that gives the Texans' defense trouble; he is capable of hitting multiple "home run" explosive plays.

### **Los Angeles Rams @ Chicago Bears**
*   **Rams -4 / -6 (Fair Price):**
    *   **Pick:** Drew (Side).
    *   **Reasoning:** The Rams have the #1 offense in football and can attack in multiple ways (13 personnel, Puka Nacua, Devante Adams). The Bears' defense is heavily injured and "Fugazi" (overrated).
*   **Rams Team Total Over 26.5:**
    *   **Pick:** Drew.
*   **Bears +7.5 (Teaser):**
    *   **Pick:** Andy.
    *   **Reasoning:** Expects Chicago to stay competitive through special teams and Caleb Williams' "magic" out of structure, even if they lose.

### **Weekend Statistical Leaders (Props)**
*   **Passing Yards:** Drake May (Drew's pick) vs. Sam Darnold (Andy's pick).
*   **Rushing Yards:** Kenneth Walker (Drew's pick) vs. James Cook (Andy's pick).
*   **Receiving Yards:** Puka Nacua (Drew's pick).

Based on the podcast transcript, here are the extracted betting picks and market recommendations for the upcoming playoff round and college football:

### **NFL Divisional Round**

**Houston Texans vs. New England Patriots**
*   **Pick:** Patriots -3 (+102)
*   **Reasoning:** Described as a "good grab" before the line moved further. Market support is moving away from Houston as star WR Nico Collins is not practicing and appears unlikely to play. The total has dropped slightly (approx. 0.5 points).

**Buffalo Bills vs. Denver Broncos**
*   **Pick:** Broncos -2
*   **Reasoning:** Significant line movement from a lookahead of Bills -1.5 to Broncos -2. Denver is "home and rested" and seeing heavy "steam."
*   **Total:** Under (Market move)
*   **Reasoning:** The total dropped two full points, primarily due to anticipated weather conditions.

**Los Angeles Rams vs. Chicago Bears**
*   **Pick:** Rams -4 (or -3.5)
*   **Reasoning:** The Rams are the only road team in the slate receiving significant market support. The Bears are viewed by the speakers as the "worst team left in the playoffs," despite having "magic"/voodoo on their side recently.

**San Francisco 49ers vs. [Opponent]**
*   **Market Note:** Niners -7.5
*   **Reasoning:** The line saw a massive adjustment from the 5.5 lookahead. However, speakers expressed concern due to injuries to George Kittle and Jair Brown (unlikely to play).

---

### **College Football**

**Indiana (Hoosiers) vs. Miami**
*   **Pick:** Over 48
*   **Reasoning:** Explicit position taken by the speaker. Expects a high-scoring, "fun" game with Miami contributing to the total, even though the market line is currently dropping.

---

### **General Market Observations**
*   **Totals:** The speakers noted that **every single total** in the upcoming NFL slate has dropped, suggesting a sharp market move toward the **Under** across the board.
*   **Home Field:** There is a general trend of support for "the homies" (home teams) this weekend, with the Rams being the notable exception as a supported road favorite.
*   **Teasers:** One speaker expressed interest in teasing the Bills or finding an open teaser with Seattle, though no specific legs were finalized.
