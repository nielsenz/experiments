Based on the podcast transcript, here are the betting picks and recommendations for the upcoming NFL Divisional Round and relevant college football markets:

### **NFL Divisional Round**

*   **Buffalo Bills @ Denver Broncos**
    *   **Line:** Pick 'em / Broncos small favorites (Line moved from Bills -1 to Broncos -1).
    *   **Pick:** **Bills (Lean)**
    *   **Reasoning:** Kevin Cole argues the Bills should be slight favorites because Josh Allen is the "best quarterback in the NFL" or in his own tier compared to the remaining field, especially when he runs in the playoffs. He believes the Denver altitude advantage dissipates late in the season.

*   **San Francisco 49ers @ Seattle Seahawks**
    *   **Line:** Seahawks -7.5 (Opened -6.5).
    *   **Pick:** **Seahawks -7.5**
    *   **Reasoning:** Both Rufus and Jeff believe the line is too short. Rufus’s numbers make it -9; Jeff suggests it should be -8 or -8.5. The 49ers are missing George Kittle and starting "no-name" receivers, while their defense lacks the pass rush needed to disrupt Sam Darnold.
    *   **Total:** 45.5 / 46.
    *   **Pick:** **Under (Lean)**
    *   **Reasoning:** Jeff finds this total high given Seattle’s strong defense and the depleted state of the 49ers' offensive personnel.

*   **Houston Texans @ New England Patriots**
    *   **Line:** Patriots -3.
    *   **Pick:** **Patriots -3**
    *   **Reasoning:** Rufus makes the line -4.5. Kevin notes that the market is over-adjusting for New England’s weak strength of schedule and undervalued their offensive efficiency. Rufus would bet the Patriots at -3 or -2.5 if available at no-vig prices.

*   **LA Rams @ Chicago Bears**
    *   **Line:** Rams -4.5.
    *   **Pick:** **Rams -4.5**
    *   **Reasoning:** Rufus makes the line -5. Kevin Cole still rates the Rams as the best team in the NFL despite a late-season slump. They view the Bears' defense as mediocre ("in the mush") and believe Caleb Williams’ inconsistent accuracy makes Chicago vulnerable.

### **College Football**

*   **Indiana vs. Miami**
    *   **Line:** Indiana -8.5 (Lookahead was 5.5, opened 7.5).
    *   **Pick:** **Miami +8.5**
    *   **Reasoning:** Rufus’s Massey Peabody ratings make this line Indiana -5.6. They believe the market is overreacting to Indiana’s dominant win over Oregon, which was heavily aided by three random turnovers. 
    *   **Recommendation:** Jeff suggests betting Miami to create a "middle" opportunity for those holding Indiana futures.

### **Futures & Positions**
*   **Indiana (College):** Rufus and Jeff are "sitting on" Indiana futures at **40-1** and **35-1**.
*   **Super Bowl / AFC:** Lean toward the **Buffalo Bills** as the favorite to win the AFC due to Josh Allen's elite play.
*   **Rams:** Jeff holds a Rams position in a "Calcutta" and remains confident despite the cold weather matchup in Chicago.
