Based on the podcast transcript, here are the betting picks and recommendations for Championship Weekend:

### **New England Patriots at Denver Broncos (AFC Championship)**

*   **Denver Broncos +3 (1st Half):** Andy recommends this based on the "unknown factor" of backup QB Jared Stidham. He believes Sean Payton will have a strong opening script that the Patriots' defense will need time to adjust to.
*   **Game Total Over 42.5 (up to 44):** Andy’s power rating for this game is 46. He notes that the weather looks good for scoring, both offensive coordinators are elite, and both defenses are currently "hair overrated." 
*   **Patriots Team Total Over 24.5:** Drew expects the Patriots to score significantly in the second half once the Denver defense (which has struggled against elite QB play) is forced to adjust.
*   **Patriots Live Bet (Second Half):** If the Broncos start strong during their scripted plays, Andy suggests waiting to bet the Patriots live (e.g., Patriots -7 in the second half) once Josh McDaniels takes over the schematic battle.
*   **Prop: Stefon Diggs Most Receiving Yards (Weekly):** Andy is backing Diggs to lead the week in yardage, expecting him to receive the "lion's share" of targets against Denver's Riley Moss and the linebackers.
*   **Prop: Trevion Henderson Wheel Routes (Over 0.5 for 30+ yards):** A specific recommendation based on the Broncos' linebackers' vulnerability in coverage.
*   **Prop: Hunter Henry & "Pop" Douglas Over (Receptions/Yards):** Both are cited as having "excellent matchups" against the Denver secondary.

### **Los Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (NFC Championship)**

*   **Rams +3 / Moneyline:** Drew is playing the Rams, citing Matthew Stafford’s experience in high-pressure "under the lights" moments. The hosts note a massive injury crisis for Seattle at the left tackle position (Charles Cross and backups are out), which favors the Rams' pass rush.
*   **Lean: Game Total Under (Reference 41.5):** While the previous meeting closed at 41.5, Drew leans toward the under for a late-season divisional grind, though he admits fear of the Rams' ability to score quickly when trailing.
*   **Prop: Jaxon Smith-Njigba (JSN) Anytime TD:** Recommended as a better value bet than Kenneth Walker III (who is expected to be priced around -200).
*   **Prop: Puka Nacua & JSN Over (Receptions/Yards):** Described as "chalky" but reliable; both hosts expect these two to "absolutely eat" against the respective secondaries.
*   **Prop: Kenneth Walker III (Avoid Rushing Leader):** Although he is the favorite for the weekend, the hosts recommend avoiding him because he is "boom or bust" and faces a very solid Seattle run defense.

### **Awards/Futures**
*   **Vance Joseph - Assistant Coach of the Year:** Andy holds a "live" ticket and believes he is the likely winner.
*   **Rams Futures:** Andy is currently "riding" existing futures positions on the Rams to win the NFC.
